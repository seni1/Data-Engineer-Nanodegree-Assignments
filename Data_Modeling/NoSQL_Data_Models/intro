When Not to Use SQL:
Need high Availability in the data: Indicates the system is always up and there is no downtime
Have Large Amounts of Data
Need Linear Scalability: The need to add more nodes to the system so performance will increase linearly
Low Latency: Shorter delay before the data is transferred once the instruction for the transfer has been received.
Need fast reads and write
